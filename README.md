# Azure and Doccer
here i want to explore about azure deployement and how Doccer affects it all.

## Azure Deployement
- Create an Azure Account: Sign up for an Azure account if you don't have one already. You can visit the Azure portal at portal.azure.com.

- Create an API: Develop your API using your preferred programming language and framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, ASP.NET, Python with Flask/Django, etc.). Make sure your API is ready for deployment, and you have the necessary code and dependencies.

- Set up a SQL Server database: In the Azure portal, navigate to the SQL Databases service and create a new SQL Server database. Configure the necessary settings such as server name, credentials, and resource group.

- Configure firewall rules: By default, Azure SQL Server blocks all external connections. You'll need to configure the firewall rules to allow access to your SQL Server database. Go to the SQL Server's Firewall settings and add the appropriate IP addresses or IP ranges to allow access.

- Deploy the API to Azure: There are different ways to deploy an API on Azure, depending on your preferred deployment method and technology stack. Here are a few options:

- Azure App Service: Create an Azure App Service and publish your API as an App Service application. You can deploy directly from source control (e.g., GitHub, Azure DevOps), or you can deploy a Docker container if your API is containerized.

- Azure Functions: If your API follows a serverless architecture, you can deploy your API as Azure Functions. Each function can be triggered by an HTTP request.

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): If you want to deploy your API using containers and Kubernetes, you can set up an AKS cluster and deploy your API as a containerized service.

- Connect the API to the SQL Server database: Update your API's configuration to use the connection string for the Azure SQL Server database you created. This connection string should include the server name, credentials, and database name.

- Test the deployment: Once the API is deployed, test its functionality by making requests to the API endpoints and ensuring it can connect to and retrieve data from the SQL Server database.
